**Technical Description**
A wireframe can be defined as a basic plan for a website which indicates the type of information that the website will contain and how the website can be arranged. 
Despite that it doesnâ€™t includes features such as color or any other particular details. User Experience (UX) can be defined as a set of technologies that increases the user satisfaction through the improvement of the usability concepts which are related to the interaction between the human users and the computers. 
The User experience is very essential on the various aspects in the creation of the different types of the products and services. In our research we are going to present a case on how the wireframes can be implemented during the website design. We are going to examine several tools used for the creation of the prototypes, wireframes, design mock-ups and the layouts to be followed during the web development.
The file contains the layout of how the prototype was implemented from the Index file as the main file.
